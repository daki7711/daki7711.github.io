## Personal Motivation/ Life Goal
 My motto is "Living, Loving, and Learning," as the author of the book Leo F. Buscaglia, Ph.D. mentioned. I always pursue learning new things not only in academia but in my everyday life. My goal is to contribute to making a loving society of understanding and empathy. [Personal History and Diversity Statement](https://daki7711.github.io/files/Personal%20History%20and%20Diversity%20Statement.pdf). 
 
 While mutual relationship between people has always been and continue to be essential, I vision a future where Artificial Intelligence (AI) collaborates with people by augmenting human capabilities, educating and training people in various tasks and activities. AI can improve the quality of individual's performance, resulting in better education, healthcare, and overall life decision making. To successfully integrate AI in to our society it is crucial for AI to understand human, specially their mind. I believe AI must have a solid understanding of human cognition, intention, and emotion, hence why I am pursuing academic study in Artificial Intelligence.

## My Academic Goal and Research
My research goal is to create a solid framework that uses Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) to infer explanatory variables of human behavior from real-world data, then further apply them to support or refute hypotheses regarding the human mind. There are various and thorough studies on this topic that have yet to be conducted. Two critical problems come to mind. 
-First, it is vague and uncertain about how to measure and quantify the mechanisms of human behavior. 
-Second, previous models are not powerful enough to fully capture thevarious factors that determine human behavior. 
I am attempting to solve the above problems with ML/DL models. More specific statement can be found in my [Statement of Purpose](https://daki7711.github.io/files/Statement_of_Purpose.pdf).

 I am currently working with my advisor [Michael C. Mozer](https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~mozer/index.php) as a Research Assitance for about an year. During this period we have published one [Workshop paper](https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~mozer/Research/Selected%20Publications/reprints/Kimetal2020.pdf) and continuing to produce more results. The overall research project focus on developing intelligent textbooks which infer student understanding based on students' interactions with the textbooks. Given a model of the student's knowledge state, we then hope to customize material for further study and review.

<!---Data were collected in collaboration with [OpenStax](https://openstax.org/), a nonprofit organization that supports open-access college-level digital textbooks. For two full semesters data were collected in Biology, Physics, Sociology, and History classes with 11,134 students. In these classes, students were able to highlight and add annotations to their e-textbooks while reading. Of the 11,134 students, 2,829 used the highlighting facility. Given the record of these highlights and annotation, we attempt to infer student comprehension, as assessed by a quiz that students take at the end of each section as well as delayed review questions administered about a week after initial reading.--->

<!---The goal is to predict quiz performance from the pattern of highlighting. In the previous workshop paper, we built separate linear models for each section of text.  (A section of text is the unit we analyze and the unit that students are quizzed on.) The input data used for prediction is a high dimensional binary feature vector where each feature indicates whether or not a given word of a section is highlighted. The first hurdle was to find the best representation of highlights as input to the linear model. In my [previous work](https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~mozer/Research/Selected%20Publications/reprints/Kimetal2020.pdf), we found that parsing the whole passage into words and reducing the dimension using PCA (Principal Component Analysis) can explain about 13% variance of the test performance. Although, this is an exciting result, this method has two problems. First, is that it is yet to be proven to be generalized in different sections and second it is extremely limited in that it is text dependent: we build a separate model for each section of text and therefore require training data for each section.
