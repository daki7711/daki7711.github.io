## My Academic Goal and Research
Generally, my interest lies on educational technology. I am interested in improving the next generation of education using state-of-the-art technologies mostly Artificial Intelligence. Specifically, I have two lines of research that I pursue.

One line of research is building new tools to democratizing computing â€” making information technology a tool for everyone, from children in school to leaders in government. Currently I am working with [App Inventor](https://appinventor.mit.edu/) at [MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory](https://www.csail.mit.edu/) with the supervision of [Prof. Hal Abelson](https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/hal-abelson). App Inventor stems from the idea that anyone should be able to take powerful computational tools and create meaningful, original mobile applications for smartphones and tablets that have impact on the world and in their daily lives.

Another research goal is to create a solid framework that uses Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) to infer explanatory variables of human behavior from real-world data, then further apply them to support or refute hypotheses regarding the human mind. There are various and thorough studies on this topic that have yet to be conducted. Two critical problems come to mind.

* First, it is vague and uncertain about how to measure and quantify the mechanisms of human behavior. 
* Second, previous models are not powerful enough to fully capture thevarious factors that determine human behavior. 

I am attempting to solve the above problems with ML/DL models. More specific statement can be found in my [Statement of Purpose](https://daki7711.github.io/files/Statement_of_Purpose.pdf).

 During my Masters Degree I have been working with my advisor [Michael C. Mozer](https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~mozer/index.php) as a Research Assitance for a couple of years. During this period we have published two Workshop papers and continuing to produce another journal paper. The overall research project focus on developing intelligent textbooks which infer student understanding based on students' interactions with the textbooks. Given a model of the student's knowledge state, we then hope to customize material for further study and review.
 
 
## Personal Motivation/ Life Goal
 My motto is "Living, Loving, and Learning," as the author of the book Leo F. Buscaglia, Ph.D. mentioned. I always pursue learning new things not only in academia but in my everyday life. My goal is to contribute to making a loving society of understanding and empathy. [Personal History and Diversity Statement](https://daki7711.github.io/files/Personal%20History%20and%20Diversity%20Statement.pdf). 
 
 While mutual relationship between people has always been and continue to be essential, I vision a future where Artificial Intelligence (AI) collaborates with people by augmenting human capabilities, educating and training people in various tasks and activities. AI can improve the quality of individual's performance, resulting in better education, healthcare, and overall life decision making. To successfully integrate AI in to our society it is crucial for AI to understand human, specially their mind. I believe AI must have a solid understanding of human cognition, intention, and emotion, hence why I am pursuing academic study in Artificial Intelligence.

<!---Data were collected in collaboration with [OpenStax](https://openstax.org/), a nonprofit organization that supports open-access college-level digital textbooks. For two full semesters data were collected in Biology, Physics, Sociology, and History classes with 11,134 students. In these classes, students were able to highlight and add annotations to their e-textbooks while reading. Of the 11,134 students, 2,829 used the highlighting facility. Given the record of these highlights and annotation, we attempt to infer student comprehension, as assessed by a quiz that students take at the end of each section as well as delayed review questions administered about a week after initial reading.--->

<!---The goal is to predict quiz performance from the pattern of highlighting. In the previous workshop paper, we built separate linear models for each section of text.  (A section of text is the unit we analyze and the unit that students are quizzed on.) The input data used for prediction is a high dimensional binary feature vector where each feature indicates whether or not a given word of a section is highlighted. The first hurdle was to find the best representation of highlights as input to the linear model. In my [previous work](https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~mozer/Research/Selected%20Publications/reprints/Kimetal2020.pdf), we found that parsing the whole passage into words and reducing the dimension using PCA (Principal Component Analysis) can explain about 13% variance of the test performance. Although, this is an exciting result, this method has two problems. First, is that it is yet to be proven to be generalized in different sections and second it is extremely limited in that it is text dependent: we build a separate model for each section of text and therefore require training data for each section.
