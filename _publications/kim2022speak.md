Abstract : MIT Aptly is a tool that automatically generates mobile apps from written or spoken natural language descriptions using OpenAI’s Codex. It lets people create programs without coding or knowledge of programming, and its app generation is based on example pairs and few-shot prompts. Aptly's performance depends on the input given to OpenAI’s Codex, and it poses challenges for research in computational thinking education. The presentation will demonstrate Aptly’s preliminary performance and review its implementation.
