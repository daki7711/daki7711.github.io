Abstract : This paper introduces Aptly, a platform designed to democratize mobile app development, particularly for young learners. Aptly integrates a Large Language Model (LLM) with App Inventor, enabling users to create apps using their natural language. User’s description is translated into a programming language that corresponds with App Inventor’s visual blocks. A preliminary study with high school students demonstrated the usability and potential of the platform. Prior programming experience influenced how users interact with Aptly. Participants identified areas for improvement and expressed a shift in perspective regarding programming accessibility and AI’s role in creative endeavors.
