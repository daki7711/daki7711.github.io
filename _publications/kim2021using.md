Abstract : As students read textbooks, they often highlight the material they deem to be most important. We analyze students’ highlights to predict their subsequent performance on quiz questions. Past research in this area has encoded highlights in terms of where the highlights appear in the stream of text—a positional representation. In this work, we construct a semantic representation based on a state-of-the-art deep-learning sentence  embedding  technique  (SBERT)  that  captures  the  content-based similarity between quiz questions and highlighted (as well as non-high-lighted) sentences in the text. We construct regression models that include latent variables for student skill level and question difficulty and augment the models with highlighting features. We find that highlighting features reliably boost model performance. We conduct experiments that validate models on held-out questions, students, and student-questionsand  find  strong  generalization  for  the  latter  two  but  not  for  held-out questions.  Surprisingly,  highlighting  features  improve  models  for  questions  at  all  levels  of  the  Bloom  taxonomy,  from  straightforward  recall questions to inferential synthesis/evaluation/creation questions.
