Abstract : We are developing an AI assistance platform that enables individuals with a limited technical background, such as children, to create mobile applications from natural language input. The platform is based on MIT App Inventor and allows users to easily edit the interface and functionality of the components of their app using textual commands. The goal of the platform is to empower children and others without a background in coding with the ability to create their own mobile applications and foster their creativity and problem-solving skills in a fun and interactive way.
