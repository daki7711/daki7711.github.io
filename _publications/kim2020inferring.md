Abstract : The study examines whether student comprehension and knowledge retention can be predicted from the material they choose to highlight in their textbooks. We found that the specific pattern of highlights made by students can explain about 13% of the variation in quiz scores. A low-dimensional logistic principal component based vector was the most effective input for a ridge regression model. Overall, highlights provide a strong signal of a student's knowledge state.
