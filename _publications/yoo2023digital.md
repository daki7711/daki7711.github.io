Abstract : Proper and delightful intervention can reduce the progression of mental disorders, but numerous physical and psy- chological barriers continue to exist. In response, we developed a mobile application called “Mind Palette”, which incorporates art therapy methodologies and generative AI technology. This application aims to address the need for comprehensive inter- ventions in the mental health crisis, particularly among younger age groups. With AI chatbot interactions and AI-generated artwork recommendations, the application may facilitate dis- cussions about emotions, encourage self-expression through art creation, and provide cognitive-behavioral therapeutic advice in both verbal and visual ways. The project highlights the human- centered approach and investigates the potential of generative AI as an effective agent for conducting art therapy.
