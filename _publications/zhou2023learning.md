Abstract : The study discusses a learning platform created using MIT App Inventor and Personal Image Classifier (PIC) to teach image classification to students. The platform aims to make learning about and using image classification models easier and more enjoyable for students. Three computer science students from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University participated in the study and successfully learned and implemented the concepts of image classification in practical software prototypes. The study shows that the platform can enhance students' interest in Artificial Intelligence and make them want to delve deeper into the mechanics of machine learning. The study concludes that the platform has the potential to improve computer science education by allowing students to apply machine learning models to solve real-world problems in their daily lives or the community.
